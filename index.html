<h1 style="text-align:left;">My First Programming Steps</h1>

<p style="text-align:left;">
This is my first attempt at web programming and<br>
I'm trying to figure out what skills to develop<br>
and what projects I will be interested in taking <br>
in the future.</b><br>
</p>

<!-- SECOND PARAGRAPH -->

<p style="text-align:left;">
One cool idea that got me started on all this is<br>
learning to create Windows 10 and Xbox apps in the<br>
Microsoft Vistual Studio IDE.  So far a picture<br>
viewer has been my best attempt.

<!-- Testing out formatting using the format in the editor below -->

<pre style="color:red;">
I'm currently trying to test out not using the line
break function that you normally would use and instead
use the pre element.  I'm not quite sure if I like doing 
this better or not because I kind of like the default
font the normal HTML is put into instead of this 
default notepad font.  However it is very convenient to 
type out anything not having to worry about adding in 
breaks whenever needed.
